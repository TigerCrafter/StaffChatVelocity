# StaffChatVelocity

StaffChatVelocity is a simple Velocity Minecraft Plugin that allows you to write with other Staffmembers easily. This is my first project and I hope you like it ❤️

## Why sould I use this plugin?

Because it's made with Heart ❤️ by me. I'm using this Plugin on my own Minecraft Server, which means that it will get Updates frequently. I would be really happy if you give it a try.

## How does is work?

### Features

- Customisable Staffchat with Discord Integration

### Commands

- ```/staffchat <message>``` sends a message to the staffchat. Alias: /sc
- ```/staffchatplugin reload (all|config|discord)``` reloads the plugin. This may take a while, because the Discord-Bot also reloads. Alias: /scpl
